## Cleaning up after the first build

After your site is online, there are a few things you should do:
- In the file `_quarto.yml`, change the `title` to your liking. You should also set the URL's to the site, repo, and issues, as indicated by the comments.
- In the file `license.md`, change the license type and the terms of the license.
- Add information in the `about.qmd` file. This is the page that will be shown when you click on `About` in the top right corner of the website.
- Add information in the `contributing.qmd` file. This is the page that will be shown when you click on `Contributing` in the top right corner of the website.
- The file `index.qmd` is the main page of the website. You can edit it to your liking.
- To learn more about Quarto websites visit <https://quarto.org/docs/websites>
- lastly, you should remove this README file, as it is only relevant for the template. You should also remove the contents of the `assets` folder, as it is not needed for your website.
